# Data-Science-Salaries-VIZ


This project is a data visualization of salaries for data science professionals in various roles and industries using Tableau. The dataset used is publicly available and was downloaded from Kaggle.

The Tableau workbook contains several visualizations, including:

A scatter plot chart that showcases the connection between average salary, experience level, and employee type

Donut charts showcasing the breakdown of company size, experience level, and employee type in terms of total number of employees

A map of the distribution of the average salaries by country

A horizontal bar chart of the job title and experience level
